  /**
   * You are given an integer array A of length N.
   * You are also given a 2D integer array B with dimensions M x 2, where each row denotes a [L, R] query.
   * For each query, you have to find the sum of all elements from L to R indices in A (0 - indexed).
   * More formally, find A[L] + A[L + 1] + A[L + 2] +... + A[R - 1] + A[R] for each query.

   * Input Format
   * The first argument is the integer array A.
   * The second argument is the 2D integer array B.

   * Output Format
   * Return an integer array of length M where ith element is the answer for ith query in B.
